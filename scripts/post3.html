<h2>Boston Marathon (April)</h2>

<p>Boston is both the hardest to qualify for and one of the most expensive to access via charity. The B.A.A.'s own charity team requires at least <strong>US$8,500</strong>. Realistically, expect <strong>US$7,500–$10,000+</strong>.</p>

<p>Individual charities open applications on their own schedules but often recruit from fall through early winter for the race the following April.</p>

<h2>TCS New York City Marathon (November)</h2>

<p>NYC might be the most charity-friendly of all the majors. NYRR requires a minimum of <strong>at least US$3,500 per runner</strong>. Plan for <strong>US$3,500–$5,000</strong> as a realistic band.</p>

<p>The lottery usually runs in February with results in early March. Charity partners recruit more aggressively after lottery results.</p>

<h2>Bank of America Chicago Marathon (October)</h2>

<p>Chicago offers one of the <strong>lowest fundraising minimums</strong> among the majors—at least <strong>US$2,200</strong>. Expect <strong>US$2,200–$2,500</strong> as your baseline.</p>

<p>When general entries close, charity entries remain one of the last ways in.</p>

<h2>BMW Berlin Marathon (September)</h2>

<p>Berlin is popular for its fast course. Fundraising minimums are generally in the <strong>US$3,000–$4,000</strong> range. Many international charity partners recruit 9–12 months before race day.</p>

<h2>TCS London Marathon (April)</h2>

<p>London is legendary for charity running, regularly setting global records for one-day fundraising. A safe planning band is <strong>£2,000–£3,000+</strong> for a charity-place runner.</p>

<p>The public ballot typically opens right after the current year's race and stays open for about a week.</p>

<h2>Tokyo Marathon (March)</h2>

<p>Tokyo is structurally different: the charity process happens <strong>before</strong> the general lottery and works more like a silent auction. The minimum donation is <strong>JPY 100,000</strong> (about US$650–$700), but typical successful bids exceed the minimum significantly.</p>

<p>The charity entry window typically runs for a few weeks in late June to mid-July.</p>
