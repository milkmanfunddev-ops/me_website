<h2>Meet Your Guide</h2>

<p><strong>Robin White</strong> isn't just any runner – she's a powerhouse in the charity running community. Having completed all six World Marathon Majors and raised over $30,000 for the Bell Center across 13 campaigns, she brings deep experience to charity fundraising.</p>

<h2>How to Get Charity Bibs</h2>

<p>Most major marathons have two main paths: <strong>general entry</strong> (lottery or time-qualifying) and <strong>charity entries</strong>. Understanding those rules is half the battle.</p>

<h3>1. Start With a Cause That Truly Matters to You</h3>

<p>Before you think about forms and deadlines, start with your "why." Charities notice when your application is deeply personal versus generic.</p>

<h3>2. Learn How Each Race Handles Charity Bibs</h3>

<p>Not every major works the same way:</p>
<ul>
<li>For races like <strong>New York</strong>, you can try the lottery first, and if you don't get in, turn to charity partners.</li>
<li><strong>Tokyo</strong> is different—the charity selection happens before the general lottery, and it's more like a bidding process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Be Concrete About Your Fundraising Commitment</h3>

<p>When you apply, go beyond "I'll raise the minimum" and outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>What amount you're committing to</li>
<li>Where that money is likely to come from</li>
<li>Any prior fundraising you've successfully done</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Write a Strong "Why I Want to Run for You" Paragraph</h3>

<p>Your story matters—sometimes more than the number. Be specific, honest, and clear about why you want to represent this charity at this race.</p>

<h3>5. Reach Out Early to Charity Partners</h3>

<p>Early contact helps you get a longer runway to fundraise and puts you on their radar as someone genuinely interested.</p>

<h2>Proven Fundraising Strategies That Work</h2>

<h3>1. Educate People About Your Cause</h3>

<p>Don't just drop a donation link. Share meaningful facts or stories about your charity in your posts, emails, and conversations.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Ask Simple and Low-Friction</h3>

<p>Robin's approach: "If everyone reading this donated $5, that would make a huge difference." Use one clear number, pair it with a one-sentence explanation, and let people know there's no guilt if they can't give.</p>

<h3>3. Give People Something in Exchange</h3>

<p>Create simple merchandise—shirts, hats, stickers—tied to your race. It's still a donation but feels more like buying something cool from a friend.</p>

<h3>4. Host Events That Create Value and Community</h3>

<p>Host a small gathering: a silent auction, movie night, or themed party. Events give people an excuse to gather and make giving feel like a shared experience.</p>

<h3>5. Don't Underestimate the Power of Your Workplace</h3>

<p>Your coworkers may not be getting hit with as many donation requests and might have access to company giving programs or matching.</p>

<h3>6. Thank Every Donor Personally</h3>

<p>Send a quick DM, text, email, or handwritten note to each donor. This turns donors into long-term supporters.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>

<p>Charity running isn't just about the miles or the money – it's about community, purpose, and the joy of running for something bigger than yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Happy Running & Happy Fundraising!</strong></p>
